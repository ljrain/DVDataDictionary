### Configuration

#### Configure Connection Settings

DVDataDictionary supports dual-environment operation, allowing you to scan one environment and store documentation in another. Edit the `appsettings.json` file with your environment details:

```json
{
  "DATADICTIONARY": {
    "CRMURL": "https://docs-environment.crm.dynamics.com",
    "CLIENTID": "your-application-client-id",
    "CLIENTSECRET": "your-client-secret-value",
    "TENANTID": "your-azure-ad-tenant-id"
  },
  "DATAVERSE": {
    "CRMURL": "https://source-environment.crm.dynamics.com",
    "CLIENTID": "your-application-client-id",
    "CLIENTSECRET": "your-client-secret-value", 
    "TENANTID": "your-azure-ad-tenant-id",
    "SOLUTIONS": [
      "YourSolutionName1",
      "YourSolutionName2"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Configuration Scenarios

**Single Environment**: Use the same environment for both scanning and storage by setting identical values in both sections.

**Dual Environment**: Scan a development/test environment while storing documentation in a production or dedicated documentation environment.

#### Configuration Parameter Details

## Understanding the Output

### Data Dictionary Components

The generated data dictionary includes several key components stored in your Dataverse environment:

#### Solution Documentation
- **Solution Overview**: Basic information about analyzed solutions
- **Component Inventory**: Complete list of entities, fields, and web resources
- **Dependency Mapping**: Relationships between solution components

#### Entity Documentation  
- **Entity Metadata**: Purpose, ownership, creation details
- **Field Catalog**: Complete field inventory with data types and constraints
- **Relationship Documentation**: How entities relate to each other
- **Business Rules**: Configured business logic and validation

#### JavaScript Analysis
- **Web Resource Inventory**: List of all JavaScript files and their purposes
- **Field Modifications**: JavaScript code that changes field behavior
- **Business Logic Documentation**: Custom behaviors implemented in scripts
- **Dependency Analysis**: Which fields are affected by which scripts

### Accessing Your Documentation

#### Within Dataverse
1. **Open your Model Driven App**
2. **Navigate to the Data Dictionary section** (created automatically)
3. **Browse entities and their documentation**
4. **Use built-in search and filtering** to find specific information

#### Reporting and Analytics
1. **Use Power BI** to create custom dashboards

### Interpreting JavaScript Analysis

#### Field Modification Types
The system identifies several types of JavaScript modifications:

**Visibility Changes**
- Fields that are hidden or shown based on conditions
- Business impact: Affects user experience and data collection

**Requirement Changes**  
- Fields that become required or optional based on logic
- Business impact: Affects data quality and validation

**Default Value Settings**
- Fields that receive automatic values from JavaScript
- Business impact: Affects data consistency and user productivity

**Validation Logic**
- Custom validation beyond standard Dataverse rules
- Business impact: Affects data quality and user experience

#### Understanding Dependencies
The analysis shows:
- **Which JavaScript files affect which fields**
- **The specific modifications made by each script**
- **Potential conflicts between multiple scripts**
- **Fields that depend on JavaScript for proper function**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How often should I run DVDataDictionary?**
A: For active development environments, weekly runs provide good balance of currency and performance. For stable production environments, monthly runs may be sufficient. Always run before major changes for impact analysis.

**Q: Can I run this against production environments?**
A: Yes, DVDataDictionary only reads metadata and configuration data. It doesn't modify your business data or configurations. However, test in development environments first to understand performance impact.

**Q: How much data will this create in my Dataverse environment?**
A: Storage requirements depend on solution complexity. Typical installations see 10-50MB of documentation data for medium-complexity solutions. Monitor storage usage and archive old versions as needed.

**Q: Can I automate the execution?**
A: Yes, the console application can be scheduled using Windows Task Scheduler, Azure Automation, or CI/CD pipelines. Ensure proper credential management for automated scenarios.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What JavaScript patterns are supported?**
A: The system recognizes common Dataverse API patterns including field visibility, requirement changes, default values, and disabled states. It supports both modern `formContext` and legacy `Xrm.Page` patterns. See the Developer Guide for complete pattern documentation.

**Q: Can I analyze custom solutions only?**
A: Yes, specify only your custom solution names in the configuration. The system will analyze only the components within those solutions, excluding standard Dataverse entities and configurations.

**Q: How does the JavaScript parsing handle complex logic?**
A: The system uses pattern matching to identify field modifications. Simple conditional logic is captured, but complex business logic may require manual documentation. The analysis provides a starting point that can be enhanced with business context.

**Q: Can I export the documentation to other formats?**
A: The data is stored in Dataverse and can be exported using standard Dataverse export features, Power BI, or custom reporting tools. The Developer Guide includes examples of export patterns.

### Business Questions

**Q: What's the return on investment for implementing this tool?**
A: Organizations typically see 300-500% ROI within the first year through reduced documentation costs, faster onboarding, and improved change management. The exact ROI depends on your team size, change frequency, and current documentation practices.

**Q: How does this help with compliance requirements?**
A: DVDataDictionary provides comprehensive, current documentation of all system configurations and customizations. This automated documentation supports audit preparation, regulatory compliance, and governance requirements by ensuring always-current system documentation.

**Q: Can business users access and understand the output?**
A: Yes, the documentation is stored in Dataverse using business-friendly field names and descriptions. Business users can access relevant documentation through Model Driven Apps with appropriate training and security configuration.

**Q: How does this integrate with existing documentation processes?**
A: DVDataDictionary provides foundational technical documentation that can be enhanced with business context, process documentation, and user guides. It complements rather than replaces business process documentation.

### Security Questions

**Q: What data does the tool access?**
A: DVDataDictionary reads metadata about solutions, entities, fields, and web resources. It also reads JavaScript file content for analysis. It does not access business data, user information, or other sensitive content.

**Q: How are credentials managed?**
A: The tool uses Azure AD application authentication with client secrets. Follow enterprise security practices for secret management, rotation, and access control. Never commit secrets to version control.

**Q: Can I run this with read-only permissions?**
A: The tool requires read permissions for metadata and web resources, plus create/update permissions for the data dictionary tables where results are stored. It doesn't require access to business data or administrative functions.

**Q: Is the JavaScript analysis secure?**
A: Yes, the tool parses JavaScript code using pattern matching without executing it. The analysis is read-only and doesn't modify or execute any JavaScript code.
