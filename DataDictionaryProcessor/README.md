  }
}
```

### Environment Configuration Options

1. **Single Environment**: Use the same environment for both scanning and storage by setting identical values in both sections
2. **Dual Environment**: Scan one environment (development/test) and store documentation in another (production/documentation repository)
3. **Multiple Solutions**: Specify an array of solution names to analyze in the `DATAVERSE:SOLUTIONS` section

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Problems

**Error**: "Failed to connect to Dynamics CRM"

**Solutions**:
- Verify your `appsettings.json` configuration for both DATADICTIONARY and DATAVERSE sections
- Ensure both Azure AD applications have proper permissions for their respective environments
- Check that client secrets are valid and not expired for both environments
- Confirm both Dataverse environment URLs are correct and accessible
- Verify network connectivity to both environments
- Test connections individually by temporarily using the same environment for both sections

#### Authentication Issues

**Error**: Authentication-related exceptions

**Solutions**:
- Verify the `CLIENTID`, `CLIENTSECRET`, and `TENANTID` values for both environments
- Ensure Azure AD applications are granted consent for Dataverse access in both tenants
- Check that application registrations are in the correct tenants
- Verify that client secrets have not expired for either environment
- Confirm cross-environment permissions if using different tenants

#### Metadata Retrieval Issues

**Error**: Missing entities or attributes in output

**Solutions**:
- Ensure Azure AD applications have sufficient permissions for the source environment
- Verify that the specified solutions exist and are published in the source environment
- Check that the target solutions are accessible to the authenticated user
- Review the console output for any filtering or permission warnings
- Verify the SOLUTIONS array in the DATAVERSE section is correctly formatted

#### JavaScript Parsing Issues

**Error**: JavaScript modifications not detected

**Solutions**:
- Verify that web resources are published and accessible
- Check that JavaScript follows supported patterns (see Developer Guide)
- Review the console output for parsing warnings
- Ensure web resources are in JavaScript format (not TypeScript or other formats)

### Performance Considerations

- **Large Solutions**: Processing time scales with the number of entities and web resources
- **Network Latency**: Connection speed to Dataverse affects metadata retrieval time
- **JavaScript Complexity**: Complex JavaScript files take longer to parse
- **Memory Usage**: Large solutions may require significant memory for metadata storage

### Logging and Diagnostics

The application provides comprehensive console logging including:
- Connection establishment and timing
- Metadata collection progress and counts
- JavaScript parsing results and warnings
- Data correlation statistics
- Overall performance metrics

For additional debugging, monitor the console output for error messages and warnings.

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management

- **Never commit `appsettings.json` to version control** if it contains real credentials
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Consider using Azure Key Vault or similar for production deployments
- Regularly rotate client secrets
- Follow principle of least privilege for Azure AD application permissions

### Network Security

- Ensure secure communication with Dataverse (HTTPS)
- Consider network restrictions for production environments
- Monitor access logs for unusual activity

### Data Handling

- The application reads metadata but does not modify Dataverse data
- JavaScript content is analyzed but not executed
- Be cautious when processing JavaScript from untrusted sources
