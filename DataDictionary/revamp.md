# DataDictionary Plugin Process Flow

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level process flow for the DataDictionary plugin execution.

## Process Steps

1. **Retrieve Solution Names**
   - Accept solution unique names as input parameter
   - Validate solution names exist in the environment

2. **Extract Entities and Fields**
   - Query solution components to identify entities
   - Retrieve entity metadata and attribute definitions
   - Collect field-level configuration and constraints

3. **Collect Web Resources**
   - Identify JavaScript web resources in the solutions
   - Decode web resource content for analysis
   - Extract dependency information

4. **Analyze Form Field Interactions**
   - Parse JavaScript code for field modification patterns
   - Identify visibility, requirement, and value changes
   - Map JavaScript behaviors to specific fields

5. **Generate Data Dictionary**
   - Correlate metadata with JavaScript analysis
   - Structure comprehensive documentation
   - Create JSON and CSV output formats

6. **Save Results**
   - Attach generated files as Notes in Dataverse
   - Provide execution logging and status information
   - Enable access to generated documentation

## Implementation Notes

- Process is designed to run within Dataverse plugin sandbox
- All operations use standard Dataverse SDK patterns
- Error handling ensures graceful failure and logging
- Output is optimized for both human and programmatic consumption
