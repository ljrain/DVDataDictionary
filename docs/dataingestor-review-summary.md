## Quick Wins (Can be implemented immediately)

### 1. Add Structured Logging (1 day)
```csharp
// Replace this:
Console.WriteLine($"Processing Solution: {ddSolution.UniqueName}");

// With this:
_logger.LogInformation("Processing solution: {SolutionName}", ddSolution.UniqueName);
```

### 2. Fix Naming (2 hours)
```csharp
// Rename InjestorV2 ‚Üí DataIngestorOrchestrator
// Rename Injestor ‚Üí LegacyDataIngestor (or remove)
// Standardize namespaces
```

### 3. Clean Project Files (1 hour)
```bash
# Remove unused files
rm DataIngestor1.csproj DataIngestor2.csproj DataIngestor3.csproj
rm Injestor.cs  # if not used
```

### 4. Add Basic Error Handling (4 hours)
```csharp
public async Task<OperationResult<T>> ProcessSolutionAsync(string solutionName)
{
    try
    {
        // existing logic
        return OperationResult<T>.Success(result);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Failed to process solution: {SolutionName}", solutionName);
        return OperationResult<T>.Failure(ex.Message, ex);
    }
}
```
