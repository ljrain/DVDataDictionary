## Solution Architecture

DVDataDictionary consists of two primary components designed for different deployment scenarios:

### DataDictionaryProcessor (Recommended)
**Enterprise Console Application**
- **Purpose**: Standalone processing for automated data dictionary generation
- **Deployment**: Desktop application or CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Use Case**: Scheduled documentation updates, development environment analysis, comprehensive reporting
- **Output**: Centralized storage in Dataverse with detailed console reporting

### DataDictionary Core Library
**Plugin and Integration Framework**
- **Purpose**: In-environment execution and API integration
- **Deployment**: Dataverse plugin registration or library reference
- **Use Case**: Real-time processing, embedded workflows, custom integration scenarios
- **Output**: Direct Dataverse storage with flexible execution patterns

*For most organizations, **DataDictionaryProcessor** provides the optimal balance of functionality, ease of deployment, and comprehensive output.*

## Core Capabilities

### Comprehensive Metadata Analysis
- **Solution Inventory**: Complete analysis of solution components including entities, attributes, relationships, and web resources
